# testapp

A new Flutter test  project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for my Flutter test application.

***To test widget classes, you need a few additional tools provided by the flutter_test package, which ships with the Flutter SDK***
***The flutter_test package provides the following tools for testing widgets:***
***The WidgetTester, which allows building and interacting with widgets in a test environment.***
***The testWidgets() function, which automatically creates a new WidgetTester for each test case, and is used in place of the normal test() function.***
***The Finder classes, which allow searching for widgets in the test environment.***
***Widget-specific Matcher constants, which help verify whether a Finder locates a widget or multiple widgets in the test environment.***
